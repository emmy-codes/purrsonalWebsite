# purrsonalWebsite (Solo project)

Trying out my own personal webpage

Being the retro nerd that I am I decided I wanted my personal website to look like a Windows 95 desktop. I wanted to stand out in a sea of identical CV's, all pushing the latest and greatest in code to look flashy, "look what I can do!" it sounded more like "look what I can Google and mash together" so I decided to go simple, or so I thought.

This took weeks of fighting uphill with CSS, every nuance was difficult trying to both use CSS sucessfully, and keeping it true to Windows 95 style. There was a lot of Googling for reference, and three cheers to whoever put the desktop icons as PNGs.

By the time the school module was up, I had a pretty good looking start page, but very little JavaScript to show for it. I vowed to come back to this project to complete it!
